<br>
<br>
<h2>History</h2>
<br>
<p class="altdesc"><b>JMCORP! Studios</b>
<br>
<br>
On October 2, 2017, JMCORP! Studios was initially established as Javier Miguel (now JMCORP! Roblox, 2024). In September 2021, the studio created a separate YouTube channel, distinguishing itself from JavierM4023 - Roblox (2021-2024). This main channel is recognized for its films, trailers, and the weekly series JMCORP! Top 10, released every Friday.
<br>
<br>
From March 5, 2021, to February 3, 2024, JMCORP! Studios collaborated with KineMaster Corporation, utilizing its video editor and watermark for enhanced video protection. However, starting February 5, 2024, JMCORP! Studios announced a shift, publishing videos without the KineMaster watermark, implementing their distinctive watermark for future YouTube content. Despite this change, KineMaster's Video Editor remains integral to JMCORP! Studios for video editing and publishing.
<br>
<br>
<b>JMCORP! Roblox</b>
<br>
<br>
Originally created on October 2, 2017, as Javier Miguel, JMCORP! Roblox's journey began with the video "Roblox Subway System," published over 5 years ago. In 2021, the channel underwent a name change to JavierM4023 - Roblox and introduced playlists of seasons, starting with Season 4. Despite Season 4 experiencing in-game lag and editing challenges, it featured over 50 videos. Season 5 faced criticism for its picture quality set at a minimum of 540p, but Season VI, released in 2023, showcased improvements with 720p video quality, the studio's watermark, animated effects, sound effects, new background music, etc.
<br>
<br>
Season VI stands out as the most-viewed season of 2023 for JavierM4023 - Roblox. The final episode, "SURVIVE THE ELIMINATION TOWER IN ROBLOX!," marked the transition to using JMCORP! Studios' watermark on YouTube videos. Season VI is the final season to be broadcasted on 720p picture quality.
<br>
<br>
<b>JMCORP! GTA Series</b>
<br>
<br>
JMCORP! GTA Series emerged as a brand extension in September 2022, with the show officially launching on April 3, 2023. Unlike other shows, it follows a consistent release schedule on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays each week. The show's content is rated TV-14 and TV-MA based on ESRB's Mature 17+ rating, with TV-14 applying to gameplay featuring blood, violence, and drug use, and TV-MA applied to missions featuring explicit language, sexual content, and drug use.
<br>
<br>
The final episode with the KineMaster watermark, "CJ Should Be Part Of The NBA One Day (GTA SA)," marked the transition as JMCORP! Studios began using its own watermark for future videos. That is also the final episode to be broadcasted on 720p picture quality.
<br>
<br>
<b>JMCORP! Minecraft</b>
<br>
<br>
JMCORP! Minecraft is the third brand extension created in September 2022, with the show's debut on December 19, 2023, marking the launch of Season 1. The decision to introduce JMCORP! Minecraft stemmed from the recognition that Minecraft content could become repetitive, often focusing on activities like building, crafting, surviving, and creating. Following the premiere of all 10 episodes for Season 1 on JMCORP! Studios, the series quickly gained popularity. Channel metrics noted that it accumulated up to 2K views from its release until the final episode aired on January 18th, 2024.
<br>
<br>
Season 1 marks the entirety of JavierM4023 - Minecraft, featuring a limited set of around 10 videos per season. These videos were published using the KineMaster watermark. However, with JMCORP! Studios' decision on February 5, 2024, to use their own watermark for future videos, Season 1 stands as the unique season with the KineMaster watermark. Season 1 is also the only season to be broadcast on 720p picture quality.
<br>
<br>
<b>JMCORP! Rocket League</b>
<br>
<br>
JMCORP! Rocket League is the upcoming brand-extended video game show created in May 2023. JMCORP! Studios has announced its eagerly awaited release, scheduled for February 27, 2024.
<br>
<br>
JMCORP! Rocket League: Season 1 will mark a milestone as the first season from JMCORP! Studios to be broadcasted in 1080p high definition. This is also the inaugural show to be released with the JMCORP! Studios watermark, replacing the previous use of the KineMaster watermark.</p>

<h2>Controversies</h2>
<br>
<p class="altdesc"><b>Roblox Account Hack 2021</b>
<br>
<br>
On September 24, 2021, the Roblox username, JavierM4023, chairman of JMCORP! Studios, fell victim to an unexpected hacking incident. An unknown user exploited the account, spamming the chat with false promises of free Robux. Consequently, the username JavierM4023 received an unjust warning from Roblox moderation due to the promotion of scams, posing a risk to other Roblox users.
<br>
<br>
JavierM4023 swiftly addressed the issue by implementing additional security measures. This involved signing out of all active sessions and adding a Personal Identification Number (PIN) to the Roblox account. In response to the incident, JavierM4023 emphasized that he "would never engage in actions to harm other Roblox user accounts." The hacking was facilitated using the Inspect Element tool on a PC browser, such as Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Firefox. The identity of the perpetrator remains unknown.</p>
<br>
